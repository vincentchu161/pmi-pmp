Complexity Matrix by Stacey
• Simple: cause and effect linkages
can be clear
• Complicated: cause and effect requires analysis or expertise; there is a range of right answers.
• Complex: Cause and effect can only be deduced in retrospect. There are no right answers.
• Anarchy: Cause and effect are unclear
• The art of management is having an array of approaches and being aware of when to use which approach.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	20

• The gulf of evaluation is the degree to which an item supports the user in discovering how to interpret the item and interact with it e?ectively. The same parking example would show a gulf of evaluation if the controls were not designed in such a way that the driver could easily determine how to initiate the self-parking function.
• The gulf of execution as the degree to which an item corresponds with what a person expects it to do. A car that has the ability to parallel park itself would have a gulf of execution if the driver expected to push a button labeled “park” and have the car park itself, and the car did not park itself.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	214

Analogous Estimating
• Uses information from a previous, similar project, such as duration, budget, size and complexity for future project.
• Analogous estimate is generally less costly and time consuming but generally less accurate.
• This estimate will be more accurate if previous project is similar in nature and not just in appearance.
• Analogous estimating is also known as top-down estimating and is a form of expert judgment using historical information.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	280

and other variables.
• More accurate than analogous estimate
• Example - A resource will take 20hrs per module and hence 50 modules will take 1000hrs (50X20 = 1000hrs)
• Estimation is done by multiplying quantity of work by labor hours per unit of work.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	281

4.  Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis	
Risk probability and impact assessment
• Probability: Probability is the likelihood that an event will occur.
– Ex: The classic example is flipping a coin. There is a .50 probability of getting
heads and a .50 probability of getting tails on the flip.
• Impact: Impact is the amount of pain (or the amount of gain for positive risks) the risk event poses to the project.
– The risk impact scale can be a relative scale that assigns values such as high- medium-low (or some combination of these) or a numeric scale known as a cardinal scale.
– Organizations can give weightage for any specific parameter/s (Normally Scope, Cost, Quality and Time) in definition of score.
• Organizations normally have defined parameters for risk probability and impact rating and thresholds however team normally tailor it for specific project during creation of Risk Management Plan.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn

Interviews
• May be used to generate inputs for the quantitative risk analysis, drawing on inputs that include individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty.
• Project team members, stakeholders, and subject matter experts are prime candidates for risk interviews
• This is particularly useful where information is required from experts.

Representations of uncertainty
• Probability distribution is to represent and analyze expert judgments and type and quantity of data collected will depend upon which probability distribution is used.
• The most commonly used are triangular, normal, lognormal, beta, uniform, or discrete distributions.
• Probabilistic branches
• Where optional activities are added to the model to represent the time and/or cost impact of the risk should it occur, and the chance that these activities actually occur in a particular simulation run matches the risk probabilityVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	505

Simulation
• Simulation typically completed through a computer software program, performed Monte Carlo analysis to simulates a project with values for all possible variables to predict the most likely model.
• Project simulations allow the project team to play “what-if” games without affecting any areas of production.
• Schedule simulations are usually performed using the precedence diagramming method, while cost simulation typically uses the WBS as its basis.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	506

• Risk acceptance is the process of simply accepting the risks because no other action is feasible; or the risks are deemed to be of small probability, impact, or both and that a formal response is not warranted.
• Passive acceptance requires no action; the project team deals with the risks as they happen.
• Active acceptance entails developing a contingency plan (contingent response plan) should the risk occur. Acceptance may be used for both positive and
negative risks.	Active acceptanceVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	519

Group discussion: Nokia Case-study	

“We didn’t do anything wrong, but somehow, we lost.”
- Nokia CEO -Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn

The final steps of the giant	
• In 2007: N95 smartphone (music features, GPS navigation, a large screen, and full internet browsing capability) .
– Software compromises were accepted to get it ready on time. It was a success,
– but serious quality problems soon emerged.
• In 2008: The 5800 first touchscreen phone.
– It was a commercial success but it was about “one and a half years late”
– because of software development problems.
• In 2009: the N97 was launched
– One top manager admitted: “a total fiasco in terms of the quality of the product.”
• In 2010 came the purported “iPhone killer” with a touchscreen
– One year later than planned,
– but it underperformed in usability and failed to match up to the sleek competition of iOS and Android.
• In 2011, A new CEO decided that Nokia would be better off buying software from elsewhere and formed an alliance with Microsoft
• In 2013, As we know, this move accelerated the company’s decline and Microsoft went on to acquire Nokia’s phone business.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn

One of the reasons	
• Nokia was, at its heart, a hardware company rather than a software company.
• Nokia’s development process was long dominated by hardware engineers;
software experts were marginalized.
• In the end, the company profoundly underestimated the importance of software, including the apps that run on smartphones, to the experience of using a phone.

The other side of the table	
• "Apple employees talk incessantly about what they call 'deep collaboration' or 'cross-pollination' or 'concurrent engineering.'
• Essentially it means that products don't pass from team to team. There aren't discrete, sequential development stages.
• Instead, it's simultaneous and organic. Products get worked on in parallel by all departments at once-design, hardware, software in endless rounds of interdisciplinary design reviews.“

Agile is a Mindset	


Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	549

Agile principles	
1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordinglyVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	550

Common misunderstandings	
• Agile has no Plan?
– No, it has Plan. But the plan accept and adapt with change
• Agile has no Document?
– No, it has Document. But it will do the document at the last responsibility moment
• Agile has no Process?
– No, it has Process. But it accepts that process will be defined by team
• Agile have no Contract?
– No, it has Contract. But the contract allow change and accept agile methodology from both sidesVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	554

• Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a
framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques.

– Lightweight
– Simple to understand
– Difficult to masterVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn

Complex Adaptive System Theory	

• Living systems are complex, in that they consist of a great many autonomous agents interacting with each other in many ways
• The interaction of individual agents is governed by simple, localized rules and characterized by constant feedback
• Complex order, known as emergent order, arises from the system itself, rather than from an external dominating force
• These complex, self-organizing Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) are adaptive in that they react differently under different circumstances, and co-evolve with their environmentVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	562

Empirical Process Control Theory	
• Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism.
– knowledge comes from experience and
– making decisions based on what is known.
• Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

• Delivery Value Early (Eat your dessert first!)
– Deliver the highest-value portions of the project as soon as possible

2.  Identifying Value: 3C of a User story	
• CARD: a physical token giving tangible and durable form to what would otherwise only be an abstraction:
• CONVERSATION: taking place at different time and places during a project between the various people concerned by a given feature of a software product: customers, users, developers, testers; this conversation is largely verbal but most often supplemented by documentation;
• CONFIRMATION: finally, the more formal the better, that the objectives the conversation revolved around have been reached.

2.  Identifying Value: INVEST in an User Story	

INVEST
A good user story should be:
• “I” ndependent (of all others)
• “N” egotiable (not a specific contract
for features)
• “V” aluable (or vertical)
• “E” stimable (to a good
approximation)
• “S” mall (so as to fit within an
iteration)
• “T” estable (in principle, even if there
isn’t a test for it yet)Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	614

2.  Identifying Value: Regulatory Compliance   

Regulatory Compliance
• Regulations are typically designed
to ensure safety
• Regulations are non-negotiable, mandatory
• Approaches
– Weave it into the regular development work as the team progresses
– To allow time after creating the product to undertake the regulatory work and produce the required evidence and documentVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	616

2.  Prioritizing Value	

Customer-Value prioritization

• Working on the items that yield the highest value to the customer first

• Learn about customers motivations, risks and acceptance criteriaVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	617

2.  Prioritizing Value	

Simple Schemes
• Label items:	•	Need a shared, defendable reason
– Priority 1, Priority 2, ...	for what defines High Priority.
– High, Medium, Low
• Problems
– Stakeholders have a tendency to designate everything in a High priority
– Too many items are High priority, the scheme becomes ineffective
– Rarely ask for a new feature and say it should be Medium or Low, since they know that low-priority items risk getting cut out of the projectVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	618

2.  Prioritizing Value	
Requirement Prioritization Model
• More mathematically method of calculating priority
• The benefit, penalty, cost and risk of every proposed feature is rated on a relative
scale from 1 to 9.
– Customer rate benefit score and penalty score
– Developers rate cost and risk
– Score will be calculated with a weighted formula

Monopoly Money
• Give stakeholder Monopoly money equal to the amount of project budget and distribute those funds amongst the system features.

Kano Analysis
• Classify customer preferences into 4	•	Understand how customer need categories		relate to customer satisfaction
• Delighters / Exciters: unexpected, novel or high-value benefit, high level of customer support
• Satisfiers: the more the better, bring
value to the customer
• Dissatisfiers: cause a user to dislike the product if they are not there, but will not necessarily raise satisfaction if they are present
• Indifferent: No impact on customers. Try to eliminate, minimize or defer themVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	624

Estimating Velocity for the 1st Iteration	

• Based on each person's capacity, which of the top-priority stories in the backlog for this release can we realistically commit to finishing in the first iteration
• The total points for these stories become our initial velocity estimate
• Because of the uncertainty of estimating initial velocity, some teams add a buffer to their velocity estimates for the first few iterationsVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	702

5.  High-Level Planning: Product Vision	

What ?
• A vision is a desired end-state, often described as a set of desired objectives and outcomes.
Why ?
• Defining and sharing a clear vision at the start of the project can enable good relationships and alignment throughout the project.
When?

Elevator statement (elevator pitch)	

• An elevator statement (often referred to as a vision statement or an elevator pitch) is a short description of a product, that helps us focus on product goals with an understanding of what the product is, what it is not, who it’s for and how it’s different compared to the competition.
• The product owner creates, manages and own the elevator statement. However, it’s essential the whole team contributes when created the vision for the product.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	705

1.  Introduction: Seller and Buyer	
• Depending on the buyer’s position in the project acquisition cycle, the buyer may be called a client, customer, prime contractor, acquiring organization, service requestor, or purchaser.
• Depending on the application area, the seller may be identified as a contractor, subcontractor, vendor, supplier, or service provider.
• The seller can be viewed during the contract life cycle first as:

1. Introduction: Contract Types	
1. Fixed Price Contract
• Firm Fixed Price Contracts (FFP ):
– Contract = $1,100,000. Any cost increase due to adverse performance is the
responsibility of the seller .
• Fixed Price Incentive Fee Contracts (FPIF)
– Contract = $1,100,000. For every month early the project is finished, an additional $10,000 is paid to the seller.
• Fixed Price Economic Price Adjustment (FPEPA)
– Contract = $ 1,100,00 but a price increase will be allowed in year two based on the Consumer Price Increase report for year one.
• Purchase Order (PO)
– Contract to purchase 30 laptops.
– This type of contract is normally unilateral (signed by one party) instead of
bilateral.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn

1.  Introduction: Contract Types	
2. Cost-reimbursable Contract
• Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)
– Contract = Cost + Fee of $100,000
• Cost Plus Fee (CPF) or Cost Plus Percentage of Costs (CPPC)
– Contract = Cost + 10% of costs as fee.
• Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF)
– Contract = Cost + Bonus for performance objectives
• Cost Plus Award Fee ( CPAF) :
– Contract = Cost + Award Fee
– The determination of the fee is solely on the subjective determination of seller performance by the buyer , and is generally not subject to appealsVersion 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn

1. Introduction: Contract Types	

3. Time and Material (T&M) or Unit Price
• A hybrid type of contractual arrangement with aspects of both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts.
• They are often used for staff augmentation, acquisition of exper and any outside support when a precise statement of work cannot b quickly prescribed.
• Ex: contract = $100 per hour + expenses or materials at cost or $1 per linear meter of wood.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	725

• Requires the seller to have an accounting system that can track costs
• Buyer requires auditing seller’s invoice• Used for service efforts in which the level of effort cannot be defined at the time the contract is awarded
• To make sure the costs do not become higher than budgeted, the buyer may put a "Not to Exceed" and time limits clause in the contract.

Contract Controlling
1. Fixed Price
• Review the statement of work to ensure that the scope is clearly understood by both parties.
• Look out for excessive change orders - it may be an indication that the seller’s
profit is being impacted.
• Audit the sellers work to ensure that scope and quality are not being impacted.
• The seller may try to cut corners in order to bring in the contract at a fixed price
without impacting their profit margin.
– Bait and switch is a typical tactic here; for example, on a construction project the seller might swap out a stainless steel electrical conduit for PVC without making the buyer aware of it.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn

Contract Controlling
2. Cost Reimbursable
• All invoices need to be audited - ensure that the work is being performed corresponds to the resources performing the work.
• Look out for additional charges that were not part of the original plan.
• If specific resources with specific skill sets have been contracted, ensure they are not replaced with lower cost, less experienced resources for the same price.
• Ensure deliverables meet their expected milestone dates. Tie payments in the
contract to delivered milestones.

3. Time and Materials
• Ensure that hours are not padded.
• Keep the project to a fixed length.
• Require that deliverables are defined and met by specific milestone dates.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn

Inspections
• As the contractor completes the contracted work, the buyer will need to inspect the work for progress, compliance with contract requirements, and adherence to agreed-to time, cost, and quality constraints.
• An inspection is a structured review of the work being performed by the contractor. This may involve a simple review of the deliverables or an actual physical review of the work itself.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	762

4.  Control Procurements	

Procurement Audits
• Procurement audits examine the procurement process to determine areas of improvement and to identify flawed processes or procedures.
• Resulting audit observations should be brought to the attention of the buyer’s project manager and the seller’s project manager for adjustments to the project, when necessary.
• The primary purpose of the procurement audit is to identify lessons learned during the procurement process.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	763

Claims administration
• A claim is an assertion that the buyer did something that has hurt the seller and the seller asking for compensation.
• Another way of looking at claims is that they are a form of seller's change requests.
• Changes that cannot be agreed upon are called contested changes.
• Claims administration involves documenting, monitoring, and managing changes to the contract.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	764

Contract change control
• The contract change control system defines the procedures for how the contract may be changed.
• It documents how to submit changes, establishes the approval process, and outlines authority levels.
• It includes a tracking system to number the change requests and record their status
• The system is part of integrated change control.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	765

Closed procurements
• The buyer, usually through its authorized procurement administrator, provides the seller with formal written notice that the contract has been completed.
• Market research shows that very few project managers actually close out procurements. Someone in contracts, procurement or legal departments usually has that authority.
• The project management team should have evaluated all completed deliverables and compared them to the contract prior to closure.Version 2.3 - All Rights Reserved © Professional Management Academy	www.pma.edu.vn	767

5.  Agile Contracting: Change for Free	
• Standard fixed-price contract, include T&M for additional work and change for free option clause
• Customer can only use change for free clause if they work with the team on every iteration. If not, the contract reverts back to T&M
• The change will be free if the total amount of contracted work has not changed
• Allow new features to be added if lower priority items that require same amount of time and effort are removed

Master Service Agreement
• In complex environments, specific sellers may be used to extend the team.
